# Amazon-Gin-Comparison
Python Code to scrape data on my favorite gins from Amazon and tell me the cheapest at that time.
main.py script contains the code to scrape the gins from Amazon and finds the cheapest. The data is stored in a csv file called "gin_parameters.cvs".
The URLs of the gins to be scrapes are in a text file called "url.txt"
Pulling too many requests at one time will cause the Scrape to be blocked by Amazon --- check terms of use.
